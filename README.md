DevTown PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP

Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by DevTown . The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with DevTown.

Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well

I got to have hands on experience on:
1. Python
2. Machine Learning
3. Tensorflow

during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn. I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit: www.shapeai.tech or follow DevTown on:
